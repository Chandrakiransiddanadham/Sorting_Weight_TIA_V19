# Siemens TIA Portal V19 Sorting Line Project

This project demonstrates the integration of **Siemens TIA Portal V19** with **Factory I/O** to create a fully simulated, virtual production line.

The system utilizes **Modbus TCP/IP** for real-time communication between the PLC and the Factory I/O environment.

**Core Functionality:**
* **Automated Sorting:** Objects are sorted on the production line based on their simulated weight.
* **Recipe Management:** Three (3) different sorting recipes are implemented for quick reconfiguration.
* **Programming Languages:** Logic is developed using a combination of **Function Block Diagram (FBD)** and **Structured Control Language (SCL)**.
